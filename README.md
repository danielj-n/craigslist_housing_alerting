## Craigslist Housing Scraper
A simple script to search for housing on craigslist with hardcoded controls.

If setup correctly it will open up the links in browser and play an alert sound
when new links are found however this may require a bit of tinkering depending
on the system.

## Dependencies
- Chromium (browser can be changed by editing BROWSER variable)
- play (part of sox: http://sox.sourceforge.net/)

## Notes
- if craigslist blocks requests (due to initial volume generated by the script)
  you may be able to get around this by clearing site cookies/data
